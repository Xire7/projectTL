Tier List Project, design proposal 2.

developing tier list website for fun as well as to learn web development over winter break. probably will only have time for frontend (html, css, javascript + react) and i'll try to learn back-end during school but its probably unlikely ? altho ill try. if there's no time we just do it over spring break gang gang. but yeah trying to get a full product here by the end of winter break ideally that incorporates everything learned from html css and javascript. will check out react too but just vanilla javascript is good too! if u are actually reading this besides myself for my own personal accountability u are nerd emoji cranium emoticon (shout outs to u).
